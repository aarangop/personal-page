To protect all routes in a directory of your SvelteKit application using Auth.js, you can utilize the `handle` hook provided by `@auth/sveltekit`. This involves overriding your handle hook in `src/auth.ts` and then importing it into your `src/hooks.server.ts`. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide based on the information provided:

1. **Define the Handle Hook in `src/auth.ts`**: Create or modify your `src/auth.ts` to include the `SvelteKitAuth` configuration along with a custom `handle` hook. This hook acts as a middleware to intercept all requests and can be used to check for user authentication.

2. **Import the Handle Hook into `src/hooks.server.ts`**: Once you have your `handle` hook defined in `src/auth.ts`, you import this into your `src/hooks.server.ts`. You can use the `sequence` function from SvelteKit to chain multiple hooks if necessary.

3. **Protecting Routes**: By implementing the `handle` hook in your `hooks.server.ts`, you can check if a user is authenticated and redirect them if they are not. The handle hook, when configured correctly, will apply to all routes within your application, enforcing authentication checks before serving the protected routes.

Here is an example of how you might set this up:

**src/auth.ts:**

```javascript
import { SvelteKitAuth } from '@auth/sveltekit';
import GitHub from '@auth/sveltekit/providers/github';

export const { handle, signIn, signOut } = SvelteKitAuth({
	providers: [GitHub]
});
```

**src/hooks.server.ts:**

```javascript
import { sequence } from '@sveltejs/kit/hooks';
import { handle as authHandle } from 'src/auth.ts';

export const handle = sequence(authHandle, yourCustomHandleFunction);
```

This setup will ensure that any attempt to access routes under the protected directory will first go through the authentication check implemented in the `handle` hook. If the user is not authenticated, you can redirect them to a sign-in route or another appropriate action.

Remember, this example uses GitHub as the authentication provider. You should replace it with the actual provider(s) you're using in your application.
